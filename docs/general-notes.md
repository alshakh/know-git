Basic setup

If you’d like, you can go ahead and save your git username and email so that you won’t have to enter them in again for future git commands.

git config --global user.name "User Name"

git config --global user.email "email"

Colours

A neat trick that some people often miss is that you can enable some extra colouring to git, so that you can read the output of the commands easier!

git config --global color.ui true
